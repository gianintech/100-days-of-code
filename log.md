# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I managed to finish up at least half of this website.

### Day 2: July 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**:
I finished the website I've been doing.

✔ Learned Bootstrap Carousels

✔ Got a grasp of Z-index and CSS stack order

✔ Understood how to use Bootstrap Cards 

✔ Media Query Breakpoints are mind opening

All are applied in the website. I'm so happy to understand and apply at the same time.

**Thoughts:** CSS can be fun and also complicated but interesting especially with z-index and stack order.

### Day 3: July 21, 2022
**Today's Progress**:
Refactored the website the I finished on Day of #100DaysOfCode

✔ Code Refactoring

✔ CSS Combining Selectors

✔ CSS Selector Priority

✔ Code Refactoring is not just removing repitition, the priority should be readability and modularity.

All are applied in the website.

**Thoughts:** The readable and modular the code, the better.
