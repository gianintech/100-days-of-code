### Day 5: July 23, 2022
**Today's Progress**:
I learned more about some keywords in Javascript such as alert, prompt, and declaring variables and assigning value.
I managed to solve the quiz with the solution that came in mind.
The quiz was about switching the value of 2 variables.

✔ Introduction to Javascript

✔ Javascript Alerts

✔ Data Types

✔ Javascript Variables

✔ Javascript Variables Exercise

**Thoughts:** 
It's quite confusing at first, but since I already have experience in programming it just came naturally for me.
